### Hey there!
I'm AfterNetwork. I don't really have much to say here, but I can say that I don't usually get on Github much because I'm not a person with programming experience.

However, I do have a connection (if very little) to the Scratch community. Inquire if you will. I wrote most of the crap here when I was younger, so ignore that.

Alright, thanks for looking at my page lmfao
